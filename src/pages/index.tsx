    <b>Hello!</b> My name is Qian and I am a software engineer with 10 years
    experience in fintech. I began creating webpages during the geocities days
    and had the pleasure/pain of coding through the webdev eras. In college I
    majored in computer engineering and obsessed over FPGA and C++. But I
    eventually found my way back home in webdev. My comfort is ASP.NET and
    React/TypeScript.
